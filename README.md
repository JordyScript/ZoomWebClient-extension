# ZoomWebClient-extension
Automatically launch the Zoom Web Client instead of the desktop client when clicking invite URLs.


All this extension does is take the zoom invitation url that ends in 
`/j/[meeting_id]?[optional_parameters]` 

and redirect it to 
`/wc/join/[meeting_id]?[optional_parameters]`
